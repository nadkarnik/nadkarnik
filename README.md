Hello, my name is Kiran. As of the last update of this README file, I am a recent (05/11/2021) graduate of the Engineering school of the University of Connecticut, in Storrs, CT. 
I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. I am currently employed by The Boeing Company as a Support Equipment Design Engineer in St. Louis, MO. 

I have professional interest in several industries including but not limited to Semiconductor Device Design and Development, Defense (Aerospace / Naval), Power Systems (Supercapacitors, Microgrids), Control Systems Engineering, and Embedded Systems Programming. I also have undergraduate research experience in the field of Atomic Layer / Thin Film Deposition on semiconductor substrates as well. Academically I plan on attending a graduate program in Computer or Electrical Engineering in the relatively near future. 

This Github page is a localization of the private, academic, and non-classified projects and/or coursework that I have participated in since starting my Electrical Engineering undergraduate education. 

Thank you for taking the time to look at some of my work,

Kiran D. Nadkarni

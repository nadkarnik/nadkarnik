Hello, Kiran here!

Some background on me: I graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2021 with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering. I am currently employed by The Boeing Company as a Electrical Design & Analysis Engineer based in St. Louis, MO. I am also, as of Fall 2023, enrolled in a Part-Time Computer Engineering MS with North Carolina State University.

I have professional & academic interest in several areas including but not limited to Semiconductor Device Design and Development, Defense (Aerospace / Naval), Power Systems (Supercapacitors, Microgrids), Control Systems Engineering, Embedded Systems Programming, and Computer Architecture. During my time as an undergraduate, I participated in Atomic Layer / Thin Film Deposition research on semiconductor substrates. My short term plans include attending an M.S. program in Electrical or Computer Engineering in the next several years as I desire a diverse set of graduate academic coursework and research experience to supplement my time in industry.  

This Github page is meant to be a localization of the private, academic, and non-classified projects and/or coursework that I have participated in since beginning my undergraduate education. 

Thank you for reading about me and looking at my work! For inquiries of any kind I can be reached at 860-876-0690 or kiran.nadkarni@uconn.edu

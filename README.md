Hello, my name is Kiran. I am a recent (05/2021) graduate of the Engineering school of the University of Connecticut in Storrs, CT. 
I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. I am currently employed by The Boeing Company as a Support Equipment Design Engineer in St. Louis, MO. 

I have professional interest in several industries including but not limited to Semiconductor Device Design and Development, Defense (Aerospace / Naval), Power Systems (Supercapacitors, Microgrids), Control Systems Engineering, and Embedded Systems Programming. During my time as an undergraduate, I paricipated in Atomic Layer / Thin Film Deposition research on semiconductor substrates. My short term plans include attending an M.S. program in Electrical or Computer Engineering in the next several years as I desire a diverse set of graduate academic coursework and research experience to supplement my time in industry.  

This Github page is meant to be a localization of the private, academic, and non-classified projects and/or coursework that I have participated in since beginning my Electrical Engineering undergraduate education. 

Thank you for reading about me and looking at my work, 

Kiran D. Nadkarni
